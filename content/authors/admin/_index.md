Di Wu is currently a PhD student in Department of ECE from UW--Madison, advised by professor [Joshua San Miguel](https://jsm.ece.wisc.edu/). His research interest lies in the field of computer architecture, including unary computing, approximate computing and reconfigurable computing. Before the PhD study, he received bachelor and master degrees from Fudan University in 2012 and 2015, as well as spending two years in Hisilicon as a digital circuit engineer. During the PhD study, he also did research internships related to deep neural network numerical optimization in Facebook and Cerebras Systems in 2019 and 2020, recpectively.
